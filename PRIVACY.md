# Privacy Policy

Loc Reminder does not collect any personal data from its users. The app is designed to function entirely on the device without requiring any external data transmission.

Loc Reminder leverages iOS's CoreLocation framework to provide location-based reminders, but this data is stored locally on the device and is not shared with any third parties.

Location is monitored using GeoFences, so iOS informs Loc Reminder when an interaction with a GeoFence occurs. This means that the app does not continuously track your location in the background, but rather only when you enter or exit a defined area.

Loc Reminder displays data on an Apple MapKit map, but this is purely for user convenience and does not involve any data collection or tracking, though it may require internet usage.
